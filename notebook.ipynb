    "### Context\n",
    "Stroke is the **2nd leading cause of death globally**, responsible for approximately **11% of total deaths**, according to the **World Health Organization (WHO)**. A stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is disrupted, leading to potential long-term disability or death. Early detection and prevention are **critical** in reducing stroke-related fatalities and improving patient outcomes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset provides **medical and demographic information** to predict whether a person is at risk of having a stroke. It includes features such as **age, gender, underlying diseases (e.g., hypertension, diabetes), and lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking status)**. By analyzing these factors, we can build a **predictive model** to help identify high-risk individuals and support early medical intervention.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of the Project  \n",
    "The goal of this project is to **develop a machine learning model** that predicts the likelihood of a patient experiencing a stroke based on their medical history and lifestyle. This will enable:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Early detection of stroke risk**, allowing for timely medical intervention.  \n",
    "- **Identification of key risk factors** contributing to stroke occurrences.  \n",
    "- **Support for healthcare professionals** in decision-making and risk assessment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance of the Study  \n",
    "By leveraging **machine learning for stroke prediction**, this project aims to **reduce preventable deaths, enhance early diagnosis, and optimize healthcare resource allocation**. A well-performing model could assist in **screening patients efficiently**, leading to better stroke prevention strategies and improved patient care."
