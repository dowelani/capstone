    "### Background Context  \n",
    "\n",
    "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the **leading cause of death worldwide**, responsible for about **17.9 million deaths each year**. This means **31% of all deaths** globally are due to heart-related issues. The most common causes of CVD deaths are **heart attacks and strokes**, with many occurring in people **under the age of 70**. Heart failure is also a major concern, often resulting from existing heart conditions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Early detection of heart disease is **critical** in preventing severe complications. People at high risk—such as those with **high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or a history of heart problems**—need regular monitoring. However, traditional methods of diagnosing heart disease can be **time-consuming and costly**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of the Project  \n",
    "This project aims to **use machine learning** to build a model that can predict the risk of heart disease based on **11 key health factors**. The goal is to make early detection **faster, more efficient, and more accessible**. The project will:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Develop a model** to predict heart disease risk.  \n",
    "- **Identify key risk factors** that contribute to heart disease.  \n",
    "- **Help doctors and individuals** take early action to prevent heart problems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Project Matters  \n",
    "By using machine learning, we can improve **early diagnosis, reduce preventable deaths, and support better healthcare decisions**. A well-designed prediction model could help doctors **quickly identify high-risk individuals**, leading to **better treatment and healthier lives**.  \n",
